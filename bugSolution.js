The problem was likely due to a combination of factors, including incorrect configuration within the project's `package.json` and a lack of detailed error handling within the Expo CLI itself.  This solution directly addresses those concerns.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// ... (project code)

//Modified package.json to include start script with error handling
//Modified package.json to include start script with more robust error handling
 "scripts": {
    "start": "expo start --devClient --maxWorkers=4 || echo 'Expo start failed. Check your Expo CLI configuration.'",
    "android": "expo start --android",
    "ios": "expo start --ios"
  },
```

By adding the `|| echo 'Expo start failed. Check your Expo CLI configuration'` to the start script, we now receive at least a basic error message when `expo start` fails. This improves debugging and diagnostics.
